- allows kernel code to export information to user processes via an in-memory filesystem.
  - virtual filesystem (virtual means it takes up no disk space).
    It exports information about kernel devices, drivers,
    and other subsystems to user space and allows their configuration.
    It is generated by the kernel and always mounted at /sys.
    
  - e.g. device tree info show to user space via sysfs. device tree info?
