- The first LBA sector is sector # zero, the same sector in a CHS model is called sector # one.

Examples:
For geometry 1020 16 63 of a disk with 1028160 sectors, CHS 3 2 1 is LBA 3150 = ((3 × 16) + 2) × 63 + (1 – 1);
For geometry 1008 4 255 of a disk with 1028160 sectors, CHS 3 2 1 is LBA 3570 = ((3 × 4) + 2) × 255 + (1 – 1)
For geometry  64 255 63 of a disk with 1028160 sectors, CHS 3 2 1 is LBA 48321=((3 × 255) + 2) × 63 + (1 – 1)
For geometry 2142 15 32 of a disk with 1028160 sectors, CHS 3 2 1 is LBA 1504 = ((3 × 15) + 2) × 32 + (1 – 1)
